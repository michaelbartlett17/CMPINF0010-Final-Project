- Description and links to the datasets used:
  - Pittsburgh Neighborhoods: [https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2)
    - General data about the 90 Pittsburgh neighborhoods that is used in conjunction with our other datasets.
  - Pittsburgh Regional Transit Transit Stops: [https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/prt-of-allegheny-county-transit-stops](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/prt-of-allegheny-county-transit-stops)
  and Pittsburgh Regional Transit Transit Routes: [https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/prt-current-transit-routes](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/prt-current-transit-routes)
    - Used to evaluate the availability of public transit in neighborhoods
  - City of Pittsburgh Traffic Count: [https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/traffic-count-data-city-of-pittsburgh](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/traffic-count-data-city-of-pittsburgh)
    - Used to evaluate high traffic neighborhoods
  - Bike Route Map: [https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/shape-files-for-bikepgh-s-pittsburgh-bike-map](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/shape-files-for-bikepgh-s-pittsburgh-bike-map)
    - Used to evaluate the availability of bike routes in neighborhoods
  - Sidewalk to Street Walkability Ratio: [https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/sidewalk-to-street-walkability-ratio](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/sidewalk-to-street-walkability-ratio)
    - Used to evaluate the walkability of each neighborhood
- An overview of your repository, meant for someone who is not familiar with the project:
  - The purpose of this repository is to analyze the best neighborhood for accessible transportation in Pittsburgh. In order to to come to a conclusion public transit routes, traffic counts, walkability ratio, and bike lane availability of each neighborhood were analyzed. This analysis is provided in `final-notebook.ipynb`
